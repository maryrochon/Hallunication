    <p>Have you ever seen someone out of the corner of your eye, that wasn’t there? You might have thought it was the light playing tricks on you or just your imagination but that is not always the case. Those cases are called seeings shadow figures. </p>
    <p>Paranormal phenom a writer Heidi Hollis coined the term shadow people. She says “Shadow people have been around since the beginning of time and are a dark influence upon society.” She goes on to say that most people who see shadow people see a man-like form but can not make out any detailed features. Her exact description is “dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision.”</p>
    <p>Psychic Ellie Crystal compares them to ghost sightings, calls them supernatural. On her website she talks about some people feel chased by them or feel sense of dread when they spot one. However psychic medium Natalia Kuna, says that though many shadow people are bad, some are neutral are more ‘guardian like’. </p>
    <p>I don’t blame you for being sceptic, this all sounds crazy. However there is some scientific evidence to explain the sightings.  Assistant professor of psychiatry at the Netherlands’ University of Groningen, Jan Dirk Blom says that sightings may be caused by sleep paralysis, that causes people to be hyper-vigilant of their surroundings. On that same note the sightings can also be caused by heightened emotional states or sleep deprivation. Blom also debunks the theory by saying that “There’s always the explanation that your peripheral vision is basically guaranteed to play tricks on you — because it’s designed to detect motion and movement, not detail, it’s likely that you could make mountains out of molehills (or in this case, shadow people out of shadows) if you were in the right mindset.”</p>
